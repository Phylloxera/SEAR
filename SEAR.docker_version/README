This is the version of the Search Engine for Antimicrobial Resistance (SEAR) that is behind the SEAR BaseSpace App (Illumina).

SEAR and it's dependencies can be run using the SEAR docker image.

The docker image can be built using the Dockerfile in the current directory using the following command:
	docker build -t 'sear:basespace' .

NOTES:
######

This version of SEAR is being actively developed.
The free alternative to USEARCH, VSEARCH, has now been implemented in the fastq filtering and clustering stages (used still in other SEAR versions)
